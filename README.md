## Scene information

Scene information coming soon. 

The scene images can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_eenUjORT25wOqAMvgp0x0v21vGZQUSH?usp=sharing). The Google directory contains four files: 
1. image_rgb - The RGB rectified hyperspectral scene.
2. image_hsi_radiance - Radiance calibrated hyperspectral scene sampled at every 10th band (400nm, 410nm, 420nm, .. 900nm).
3. image_hsi_reflectance - Reflectance calibrated hyperspectral scene sampled at every 10th band (400nm, 410nm, 420nm, .. 900nm).
4. image_labels - Semantic labels for the entire AeroCampus scene.

## Codebase
Basic code API coming soon.
